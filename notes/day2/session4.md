# Central Limit Theorem

The central limit theorem (CLT) is a statistical principle stating that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal, regardless of the original population's distribution, as long as the sample size is large enough

Even for skewed distributions, the CLT holds true when the sample size is sufficiently large (typically n > 30).

If the population is normally distributed, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will also be normal for any sample size n.

In practice, a sample size of 30 or more is often considered sufficient for the CLT to apply.
