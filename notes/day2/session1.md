# Sampling

## What is Sampling?

When you conduct research about a group of people, it’s rarely possible to collect data from every person in that group. Instead, you select a sample. The sample is the group of individuals who will actually participate in the research.

To draw valid conclusions from your results, you have to carefully decide how you will select a sample that is representative of the group as a whole. This is called a sampling method.

## Types of Sampling Methods

There are two primary types of sampling methods that you can use in your research:

- **Probability sampling** involves random selection, allowing you to make strong statistical inferences about the whole group.
- **Non-probability sampling** involves non-random selection based on convenience or other criteria, allowing you to easily collect data.

## Population vs. sample

- The population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about.
- The sample is the specific group of individuals that you will collect data from.
  The population can be defined in terms of geographical location, age, income, or many other characteristics.

Population vs sample - It can be very broad or quite narrow : maybe you want to make inferences about the whole adult population of your country; maybe your research focuses on customers of a certain company, patients with a specific health condition, or students in a single school.

It is important to carefully define your target population according to the purpose and practicalities of your project.

If the population is very large, demographically mixed, and geographically dispersed, it might be difficult to gain access to a representative sample. A lack of a representative sample affects the validity of your results, and can lead to several research biases, particularly sampling bias.

## Sampling frame

The sampling frame is the actual list of individuals that the sample will be drawn from. Ideally, it should include the entire target population (and nobody who is not part of that population).

```text
Example:
You are doing research on working conditions at a social media marketing company.
Your population is all 1000 employees of the company.
Your sampling frame is the company’s HR database, which lists the names and contact details of every employee.
```

## Sample size

The number of individuals you should include in your sample depends on various factors, including the size and variability of the population and your research design.
There are different sample size calculators and formulas depending on what you want to achieve with statistical analysis.

## Probability sampling methods

- Probability sampling means that every member of the population has a chance of being selected.
- It is mainly used in quantitative research.
- If you want to produce results that are representative of the whole population, probability sampling techniques are the most valid choice.

## Methods of Probability Sampling

> Note: Our syllabus only has Random and Stratified sampling methods.

### Simple Random Sampling

- In a simple random sample, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
- Your sampling frame should include the whole population.
- To conduct this type of sampling, you can use tools like random number generators or other techniques that are based entirely on chance.

```markdown
Example:
You want to select a simple random sample of 1000 employees of a social media marketing company.
You assign a number to every employee in the company database from 1 to 1000, and use a random number generator to select 100 numbers.
```

### Systematic Sampling

- Systematic sampling is similar to simple random sampling, but it is usually slightly easier to conduct.
- Every member of the population is listed with a number, but instead of randomly generating numbers, individuals are chosen at regular intervals

```markdown
Example :
All employees of the company are listed in alphabetical order. From the first 10 numbers, you randomly select a starting point: number 6. From number 6 onwards, every 10th person on the list is selected (6, 16, 26, 36, and so on), and you end up with a sample of 100 people.
```

### Stratified Sampling

- Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subpopulations that may differ in important ways. - It allows you draw more precise conclusions by ensuring that every subgroup is properly represented in the sample.
- To use this sampling method, you divide the population into subgroups (called strata) based on the relevant characteristic (e.g., gender identity, age range, income bracket, job role).
- Based on the overall proportions of the population, you calculate how many people should be sampled from each subgroup. Then you use random or systematic sampling to select a sample from each subgroup.

```markdown
Example :
The company has 800 female employees and 200 male employees.
You want to ensure that the sample reflects the gender balance of the company, so you sort the population into two strata based on gender.
Then you use random sampling on each group, selecting 80 women and 20 men, which gives you a representative sample of 100 people.
```

### Cluster Sampling

- Cluster sampling also involves dividing the population into subgroups, but each subgroup should have similar characteristics to the whole sample.
- Instead of sampling individuals from each subgroup, you randomly select entire subgroups.
- If it is practically possible, you might include every individual from each sampled cluster.
- If the clusters themselves are large, you can also sample individuals from within each cluster using one of the techniques above. This is called multistage sampling.
- This method is good for dealing with large and dispersed populations, but there is more risk of error in the sample, as there could be substantial differences between clusters.
- It’s difficult to guarantee that the sampled clusters are really representative of the whole population.

```markdown
Example :
The company has offices in 10 cities across the country (all with roughly the same number of employees in similar roles). You don’t have the capacity to travel to every office to collect your data, so you use random sampling to select 3 offices – these are your clusters.
