# Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics

## 1. Descriptive Statistics

### **Definition**

Descriptive statistics are methods used to summarize, organize, and present data.  
They describe the dataset without making predictions or generalizations.

### **Purpose**

- Make raw data understandable
- Identify patterns and basic characteristics

### **Components**

#### A. Measures of Central Tendency

- Mean
- Median
- Mode

#### B. Measures of Dispersion

- Range
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
- Interquartile Range (IQR)

#### C. Graphical Methods

- Histograms
- Bar charts
- Pie charts
- Line graphs
- Box plots
- Scatter plots

### **Features**

- Describes only the given dataset
- No predictions made
- Does not use probability
- Helps simplify large datasets

### **Examples**

- Average marks of a class
- Most purchased product
- Standard deviation of monthly sales

## 2. Inferential Statistics

### **Definition**

Inferential statistics use sample data to make predictions, conclusions, or generalizations about a population.

### **Purpose**

- Estimate population parameters
- Test hypotheses
- Make predictions
- Measure uncertainty

### **Components**

#### A. Estimation

- Point estimation
- Interval estimation (Confidence Intervals)

#### B. Hypothesis Testing

- Z-test
- t-test
- Chi-square test
- ANOVA
- Regression analysis

#### C. Probability Distributions

- Normal distribution
- t-distribution
- Chi-square distribution
- Sampling distributions

### **Features**

- Works with sample data
- Generalizes results to population
- Uses probability and p-values
- Supports decision making

### **Examples**

- Predicting election results from surveys
- Testing drug effectiveness
- Comparing two group performances
- Forecasting future sales

| Feature         | Descriptive Statistics    | Inferential Statistics          |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Purpose         | Describe the data         | Make predictions or conclusions |
| Data Used       | Entire dataset            | Sample from population          |
| Output          | Summaries, tables, graphs | Estimates, tests, probabilities |
| Probability Use | No                        | Yes                             |
| Generalization  | No                        | Yes                             |
| Examples        | Mean, SD, charts          | Hypothesis tests, CI            |

## One-Line Summary

**Descriptive statistics describe what the data shows.  
Inferential statistics draw conclusions about the population beyond the data.**
