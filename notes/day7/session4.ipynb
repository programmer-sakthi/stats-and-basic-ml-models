    "# Interpreting Coefficients and adjusted R² \n",
    "\n",
    "## Unstandardized vs Standardized Coefficients\n",
    "- Unstandardized coefficients are in the original units of the predictors, while standardized coefficients are in standard deviation units.\n",
    "- Standardized coefficients allow for comparison of the relative importance of predictors.\n",
    "- Standardized coefficients are useful when predictors are on different scales.\n",
    "- they remain consistent regardless of units \n",
    "- This allows for direct comparision of the effect sizes of different predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "example :\n",
    "\n",
    "consider age and weight as predictors of blood pressure.\n",
    "- Unstandardized coefficients:\n",
    "  - Age coefficient: 0.5 (each additional year increases blood pressure by 0.5 mmHg)\n",
    "  - Weight coefficient: 0.2 (each additional pound increases blood pressure by 0.2 mmHg)\n",
    "- Standardized coefficients:\n",
    "  - Age coefficient: 0.6 (age has a stronger effect on blood pressure)\n",
    "  - Weight coefficient: 0.4 (weight has a weaker effect on blood pressure)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## p-value \n",
    "\n",
    "- helps to determine if the relationship between the indepenedent variable and dependent variable is statistically significant.\n",
    "- A low p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates that the predictor is significantly associated with the outcome variable.\n",
    "- A high p-value suggests that the predictor may not have a meaningful impact on the outcome variable (random chance).\n",
    "\n",
    "## R - Multiple correlation coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measures the correlation between the dependent variable and all independent variables combined.\n",
    "- R ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no correlation and 1 indicates perfect correlation.\n",
    "- A higher R value indicates a stronger relationship between the predictors and the outcome variable\n",
    "\n",
    "## R² - Coefficient of determination\n",
    "\n",
    "- Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables.\n",
    "- R² ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means the model explains none of the variance and 1 means it explains all the variance.\n",
    "- A higher R² value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.\n",
    "- eg : An R² of 0.75 means that 75% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adjusted R²\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjusted R² is a modified version of R² that takes into account the number of predictors in the model.\n",
    "- When there are multiple predictors, R² can artificially increase even if the new predictors do not improve the model.\n",
    "- Adjusted R² penalizes the addition of irrelevant predictors, providing a more accurate measure of model fit."
