# Chi-Square Test

A Pearson’s chi-square test is a statistical test for categorical data.
It is used to determine whether your data are significantly different from what you expected.
There are two types of Pearson’s chi-square tests:

- The **_chi-square goodness of fit test_** is used to test whether the frequency distribution of a categorical variable is different from your expectations.
- The **_chi-square test of independence_** is used to test whether two categorical variables are related to each other.
