    "# K - means clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points into clusters based on their features. The algorithm works by partitioning the data into K clusters, where K is a user-defined parameter. The goal of K-means clustering is to minimize the distance between data points within the same cluster while maximizing the distance between different clusters.\n",

    "### Centeroid :\n",
    "In K-Means clustering, a centroid is the center point of a cluster.\n",
    "It represents the mean position of all the data points assigned to that cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each cluster has one centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Centroids are not actual data points; they are calculated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- During training, K-Means moves centroids repeatedly to minimize the within-cluster distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal is to place centroids such that the total distance between each point and its cluster’s centroid (inertia) is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elbow Method : \n",
    "\n",
    "The Elbow Method is a technique to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) to use in K-Means.\n",
    "Choosing too few clusters oversimplifies the pattern, while too many clusters overfits the data.\n",
    "The elbow method helps find a balance.\n",

    "#### How it works ? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Run K-Means for different values of K (e.g., 1 to 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each K, compute inertia — the sum of squared distances between each point and its cluster centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plot K vs. inertia.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interpretation \n",
    "\n",
    "- As K increases, inertia decreases (clusters fit better).\n",
    "\n",
    "- But after a certain K, the rate of improvement drops sharply.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This point on the graph where the curve bends like an “elbow” is considered the optimal K.\n",
