# Program Description

# Create the  program calculates the probability of drawing two Kings consecutively without replacement from a deck of cards. The user provides the initial number of Kings and the total number of cards in the deck. The program then computes:

# The probability of drawing the first King from the deck.

# The probability of drawing the second King given that the first drawn card was a King (and not replaced).

# The overall probability of drawing two Kings consecutively without replacement.

# Input format :
# The program takes two integer inputs from the user:

# Number of Kings in the deck — an integer K (must be ≥ 0 and ≤ total cards)

# Total number of cards in the deck — an integer N (must be > 0)

# Output format :
# Initial number of Kings and total cards in the deck.

# Probability of drawing the first King (rounded to 4 decimal places).

# Number of Kings and total cards remaining after drawing the first King.

# Probability of drawing the second King given the first was a King (rounded to 4 decimal places).

# Overall probability of drawing two Kings consecutively without replacement (rounded to 4 decimal places).

# Code constraints :
# K (number of Kings) must be a non-negative integer and cannot exceed the total number of cards.

# N (total cards) must be a positive integer.

# The deck must contain at least one card.

# If the deck has only one card, the program will stop since drawing a second card is impossible.

# Inputs must be valid integers; otherwise, the program shows an error and exits.

# Sample test cases :
# Input 1 :
# 4
# 52
# Output 1 :
# Enter the number of Kings in the deck: Enter the total number of cards in the deck: 
# Initial Kings in deck: 4
# Initial total cards in deck: 52
# Probability of drawing the first King: 0.0769
# Kings remaining after first draw: 3
# Total cards remaining after first draw: 51
# Probability of drawing the second King (given first was King and not replaced): 0.0588
# Probability of drawing two Kings consecutively without replacement: 0.0045
