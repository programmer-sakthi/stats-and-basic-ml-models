# Program Description

# Create the  program simulates a set of coin tosses and calculates the probability of heads and tails based on the number of tosses. It also calculates the theoretical probability of rolling a specific number on a standard six-sided die.

# Input format :
# The program takes two inputs:

# Number of coin tosses — an integer N (must be ≥ 0)

# Desired dice number — an integer D (must be between 1 and 6)

# Output format :
# Coin Toss Results:

# Total number of heads and tails observed

# Probability of heads (rounded to two decimal places)

# Probability of tails (rounded to two decimal places)

# Dice Roll Probability:

# The theoretical probability of rolling the desired number on a 6-sided die (as a fraction and decimal)

# If inputs are invalid, appropriate error messages are shown.

# Code constraints :
# num_tosses must be a non-negative integer

# Example: 0, 10, 100 are valid.
# desired_dice_number must be an integer between 1 and 6

# Only values from 1 to 6 are allowed.
# If num_tosses is 0, the program should show a message and not calculate probabilities.

# Inputs must be valid integers

# If not, the program should display an error and stop.
# Coin tosses should be randomly chosen as either 'Head' or 'Tail' for each toss.

# Dice probability is fixed
# The chance of rolling any number from 1 to 6 is always 1/6.

# Probabilities should be rounded:

# Coin toss results: rounded to 2 decimal places
# Dice roll probability: shown as both fraction and 4-digit decimal (e.g., 0.1667)
# Sample test cases :
# Input 1 :
# 10
# 3
# Output 1 :
# Enter number of coin tosses: Enter desired dice number (1–6): 
# --- Coin Toss Results ---
# Head: 4, Tail: 6
# Probability of Head: 0.40
# Probability of Tail: 0.60

# --- Dice Roll Probability ---
# The probability of rolling a 3 is: 0.1667
# Which is also: 1/6
